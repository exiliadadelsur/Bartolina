# Bartolina

Bartolina is a real space reconstruction algorithm that corrects galaxy positions by Kaiser and Finger of God effects. 
We follow the work carried out in [Shi et al. 2016, ApJ, 833, 241](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/833/2/241/pdf).

Bartolina has the following queries implemented:
* **ReFoGSpace**: Reconstruct Finger of God space. Corrects the Finger of God effect only.
* **ReKaiserSpace**: Reconstruct Kaiser space. Corrects the Kaiser effect only.
* **ReRealSpace**: Reconstruct real space. Corrects both effects.
